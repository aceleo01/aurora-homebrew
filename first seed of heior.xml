    <description>
      The Firstseed of Heior — Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement).<br/>
      <strong>Timeless Vitality.</strong> While attuned to the Seed, your natural lifespan is doubled and you no longer show physical signs of aging. You are immune to disease and cannot be aged magically.<br/>
      <strong>Constitution of the Eternal.</strong> Your Constitution score becomes 19 while you are attuned to the Seed. This has no effect if your Constitution is already 19 or higher.<br/>
      <strong>Unrelenting Resilience.</strong> Once per day, the first time you would drop to 0 hit points as a result of damage, instead drop to 1 hit point.<br/>
      <strong>Siphoning Strikes.</strong> Once per day, you may empower your melee attacks for 1 round with life‑draining energy. During this round, you heal hit points equal to half the damage you deal with melee weapon attacks.<br/>
      <strong>Aura of Renewal.</strong> You emanate a 10‑foot aura in which you and creatures of your choice are unaffected by the Curse of Dessication.<br/>
      <strong>Verdant Cantrips.</strong> You learn the <em>Druidcraft</em> and <em>Thorn Whip</em> cantrips. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these.<br/>
      <strong>Seed Spells.</strong> While attuned to the Seed, you may cast each of the following spells once per day without expending a spell slot. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells:<br/>
      1st — Create or Destroy Water, Detect Poison and Disease, Purify Food and Drink, Speak with Animals<br/>
      2nd — Gust of Wind, Spike Growth, Wither and Bloom<br/>
      3rd — Plant Growth, Speak with Plants, Blight<br/>
      4th — Aura of Purity, Stone Shape<br/>
      5th — Greater Restoration
